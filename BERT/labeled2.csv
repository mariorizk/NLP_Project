In addition, automation makes immigration obsolete and particularly so in the driving category where low-skilled foreigners congregate.

162,"                    Governor Ducey speaking about autonomous vehicles on Arizona roads. (Courtesy)                   PHOENIX â€“ With hundreds of them already on Arizona roads, Gov. Doug Ducey is laying out some new â€“ and stricter â€“ rules for autonomous vehicles. In an extensive executive order Thursday, the governor is now requiring that any company wanting to operate driverless vehicles to comply with standards adopted last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That mandate is necessary as those standards are only voluntary. The order also contains some new safety requirements. Most notable is that they be programmed to go into a â€œminimal risk conditionâ€™â€™ if there is a problem with the programming or even if the vehicle encounters something that it does not understand. In essence, that could mean pulling over to the side of the road and, if necessary, shutting down.",1

164,"VANCOUVER â€“ She lost her sail and has a few scratches, but a robotic sailboat has returned home in relatively good condition after being lost at sea. The self-navigating â€œsailbotâ€ â€” a 5.5-metre solar-powered vessel â€” was rescued off the coast of Florida in December and has now returned to Vancouver.

Ahead of the trial, the company held a ceremony at its headquarters in Tokyo on Wednesday and demonstrated a self-driving vehicle on a nearby public road. Japan Post President Kunio Yokoyama said at the ceremony that the company has a ""social responsibility"" to offer delivery services in a sustainable manner. ""The introduction of self-driving vehicles is a pressing agenda,"" he said. In the trial, an autonomous vehicle will depart from the company's headquarters in the central Tokyo district of Kasumigaseki and drive about 2 kilometers to a post office in the Ginza neighborhood, stopping at another post office en route.",1
500,"                             Airbus, Audi and Italdesign have joined forces to develop a modular passenger drone and electric car hybrid named â€œPop.Up Nextâ€. The companies revealed concept art and a model of the vehicle at the Geneva Motor Show this week.                          Pop.Up Next is intended as the lighter, faster successor to Pop.Up, a similar vehicle concept revealed at the Geneva Motor Show last year. Airbus has been working on a number of projects involving electric aircraft. In February, it tested a full-scale version of its flying taxi, â€˜Vahanaâ€™, which is also autonomous and fully electric. Airbusâ€™ partnerships with Audi and Italdesign, however, have allowed its previous concepts to be combined with electric cars with the engineering expertise of its collaborators.",1
502,"Uberâ€™s push to elevate the future of the trucking industry leapt out of the testing period earlier this week. The company announced that it is officially operating a self-driving fleet (still equipped with an Uber-employed driver at all times) on the highways of Arizona via its Uber Freight app, using a transfer hub model and human drivers to deliver the cargo in the last legs of the trip.Â  According to Uber, this transfer hub system is meant to eventually create a safe 24/7 delivery system, add more jobs in the short term, and create a better quality of life for truck drivers. But its self-driving fleet, while making great advances on the open road, wonâ€™t be up to snuff for navigating city streets even on the distant horizon. In the interim, shipping companies can utilize the system through the Uber Freight app to lock down a truck driver who will meet the self-driving unit at a transfer hub at the edge of a city.Â ",1
505,"This is Volkswagenâ€™s vision of the family car of the future â€“ otherwise known as the â€˜smart lounge on wheelsâ€™.

The car is operated by voice and gesture control - with the passenger simply having to state where they want to go and use a hand signal to get the car to move. And it even â€˜recognisesâ€™ its owners via a facial scan, opening the door for them. Volkswagen has unveiled its I.D Vizzion concept car that is fully electric and self-driving at the Geneva motor show, There is no steering wheel, pedals or even a dashboard. The car recognises its owners, opens the door for them and then adjusts the settings - such as music, temperature and lighting â€“ to adapt to the personal preferences of the passengers.

Mark Dayton formed a group Wednesday to delve into the tricky policy and infrastructure questions that will accompany the arrival of autonomous vehicles. The 15-member advisory council will take up traffic regulations, privacy concerns and many other matters, with policy recommendations due to the DFL governor by December. The creation of the council elevates what has been growing chatter among local academics, planners and others about self-driving cars. At a Wednesday news conference, Transportation Commissioner Charlie Zelle noted that vehicles with autonomous features, such as automatic parallel parking, are already on the road.

The Los Angeles Times reports that of six crash reports filed in California so far this year, two involved a person attacking a robot car. Both incidents happened in San Francisco, according to Department of Motor Vehicles records. On Jan. 2, a vehicle operated by General Motorsâ€™ Cruise driverless car division was waiting at a green light for pedestrians to cross when a shouting man ran across the street against the do-not-walk signal and struck its bumper and hatch, damaging a taillight. The car was in autonomous mode but a driver was behind the wheel.

A third of traffic collisions involving autonomous vehicles in 2018 so far featured humans physically confronting the cars, according to data released by California. In one case, a taxi driver exited his cab and slapped the front passenger window of a General Motors Cruise parked behind him. No one was hurt, though the car sustained a scratch. In another case, a pedestrian hurtled across an intersection despite a â€œdo not walkâ€ sign, shouting as he went, and rammed his body into a different Cruiseâ€™s rear bumper. If they were hoping to register their disapproval of autonomous cars, they were working against both the burgeoning autonomous car industry and the state of California, which last week said it would allow driverless cars to operate without onboard backup drivers.",1

690,"The number of self-driving cars on the road will doubtless increase year upon year, changing the way we drive and the face of transport forever. One of their claimed advantages is that they will virtually put an end to road traffic collisions, but as the latest news from California shows, thereâ€™s no immediate prospect of accident free roads. Many people are unaware of the number of self-driving cars already on Americaâ€™s roads, but leading car manufacturers such as General Motors are currently carrying out extensive on-road testing of these vehicles, with a human driver also on board should an emergency arise. Current legislation in the state of California makes it compulsory for an accident report to be filed for any kind of crash or incident involving a driverless vehicle, and 27 such reports were filed in 2017. The number of reports seems to be on the rise however, with six reports already filed in January and February.",1

With the help of previous research and data from the IUCN Red List and UN databases the team tabulated the threats, statuses and conservation efforts in 90 countries in Central and South America, Asia, mainland Africa and Madagascar. â€œWhat was surprising from our global analysis is that many species in the four regions are threatened and a higher number have their populations declining,â€ told Mongabay Alejandro Estrada, lead author of the study and senior research scientists at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",2

By 2020, GM, Tesla, Daimler and Volvo expect their cars to be able to take control of discrete driving tasks - such as motorway driving - but allow the driver to retain overall control. By contrast, Google is betting on a more disruptive strategy. By 2020, Google expects its fully autonomous robot car - which has no steering wheel or pedals - to be commercially available.
